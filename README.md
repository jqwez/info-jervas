This repository is the source of what lives at info.jervas.com, my personal page! I figured I should open it up as I plan to show off some of the fun silly animations and page designs as I try them out. Although I will be inspired by other creators and use technologies that are above my programming level to create from scratch, I intend to use this as a learning opportunity and try to code interesting aspects myself. Feel free to make any requests!

Changed from a bright default theme to something a little sleeker. Feel free to look back at what it used to be like at old-page branch.

Added a webhook so that changes in this repository are automatically updated on my server. I'll look to add that to any apps as well!
